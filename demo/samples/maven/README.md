The JRXML files represent the source files for static report templates. These report templates need to be prepared for use at runtime by compiling them into `*.jasper` files, which are basically serialized [JasperReport](https://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/api/net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JasperReport.html) objects, ready for filling with data.

Report template source files having the `*.jrxml` file extensions are compiled into serialized object files having the `*.jasper` file extension, just like Java source files having the `*.java` file extension are transformed into Java bytecode binary files with the `*.class` file extension.
The transformation of `*.jrxml` files into `*.jasper` files should be part of the application build process, just as the compilation of `*.java` files into `*.class` files is. In the majority of cases, when the report templates are static and do not change at runtime (only data feed into them changes), there is no point in deploying source JRXML files with the application.
After all, when deploying a Java application, you deploy `*.class` files, packaged up in JARs, not source `*.java` files. The same technique is applicable to JR report template files, where compiled `*.jasper` files should be created at application built time and then deployed as part of the application classpath as resources.

The JasperReports library provides an official Maven Plugin for compiling source `*.jrxml` report template files into `*.jasper` files.

This plugin can be declared inside a `pom.xml` file like this:

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>net.sf.jasperreports</groupId>
  <artifactId>jasperreports-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${jasperreports.version}</version>
</plugin>
```

This plugin scans resources folders and looks up for source report template `*.jrxml files` and compiles them into `*.jasper` files which are placed into the output folder hierarchy.
The output/target folder tree is similar to the source folder tree, meaning that the relative location of source files from the root source folder is preserved for the resulting `*.jasper ` files.

By default, the plugin uses the same JasperReports Library version as the plugin version. In order to use a different version of the JasperReport Library than the one represented by the plugin's own version, the `<dependencies>` section of the plugin needs to be configured as follows:

- for target versions 7.0.6 and later, the following dependency needs to be placed in the plugin configuration, which completely overrides the plugins's own JasperReports Library BOM:

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>net.sf.jasperreports</groupId>
  <artifactId>jasperreports-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${jasperreports.version}</version>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.sf.jasperreports</groupId>
      <artifactId>jasperreports-maven-plugin-bom</artifactId>
      <version>${desired.jasperreports.version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</plugin>
```

- for versions older than 7.0.6, the plugin's own JasperReports Library BOM should first be inhibited, and in addition to that, the JasperReports Library artifacts of the desired version need to be added, depending on which extensions and custom component artifacts the source report templates make use of:

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>net.sf.jasperreports</groupId>
  <artifactId>jasperreports-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${jasperreports.version}</version>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.sf.jasperreports</groupId>
      <artifactId>jasperreports-maven-plugin-bom</artifactId>
      <version>${desired.jasperreports.version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
          <groupId>*</groupId>
          <artifactId>*</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
      </exclusions>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.sf.jasperreports</groupId>
      <artifactId>jasperreports</artifactId>
      <version>6.21.0</version>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
      <optional>false</optional>
    </dependency>
    ...
  </dependencies>

## <a name='decompile'>Generating</a> the JRXML Source Files for Multiple Compiled Report Template Files Using the JasperReports Maven Plugin (Decompiling)
<div align="right">Documented by <a href='mailto:teodord@users.sourceforge.net'>Teodor Danciu</a></div>

**Description / Goal**\
How to re-create the JRXML source files for multiple compiled report templates using the JasperReports Maven Plugin. This is useful in cases where only the compiled `*.jasper` files of older reports are available, the initial `*.jrxml `source files being lost.

**Since:** 7.0.6


In case the older reports JRXML templates are lost, but we still have access to their `*.jasper` compiled version, there is a possibility to retrieve the related JRXML, based on a specific Maven plugin goal. This goal is used for decompiling [JasperReport](https://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/api/net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JasperReport.html) objects serialized as `*.jasper` files and works as opposite to the report compilation goal described above.
This goal scans source folders and looks up for `*.jasper` files, load them into in-memory [JasperReport](https://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/api/net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JasperReport.html) objects, then write their report template source into corresponding `*.jrxml` files, placed into a destination folder hierarchy.

The destination folder tree is similar to the source folder tree, meaning that the relative location of `*.jasper` files from the root folder is preserved for the resulting `*.jrxml` files.

Here is an example of how to configure the `decompile` Maven plugin goal:

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>net.sf.jasperreports</groupId>
  <artifactId>jasperreports-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${jasperreports.version}</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>default-cli</id>
      <configuration>
        <sourceDirectoryDecompile>${project.build.directory}/reports</sourceDirectoryDecompile>
        <outputDirectoryDecompile>${project.build.directory}/reports-decompile</outputDirectoryDecompile>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

## <a name='update'>Updating</a> Multiple Report Template Files Using the JasperReports Maven Plugin
<div align="right">Documented by <a href='mailto:teodord@users.sourceforge.net'>Teodor Danciu</a></div>

**Description / Goal**

How to update all your JRXML report source files using the JasperReports Maven Plugin, in order to perform the same modification on them or to bring them up-to-date with respect to the JasperReports Schema Reference.

**Since:** 7.0.6


A problem that may occur in applications with several report templates stored in the same resource repository is the amount of time required to modify each report template individually when the same change has to be applied for all reports. Manual modification is not the best practice in this case, the entire process should be done automatically.
Based on the fact that JRXML templates can be read into [JasperDesign](https://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/api/net/sf/jasperreports/engine/design/JasperDesign.html) objects that can be easily modified and then saved again as JRXML templates, we only need to know where the initial JRXML templates are located, and which changes are to be applied, in order to process a bulk update on all these templates.

### Report Updaters

Changes can be very easily applied on report designs using specific [ReportUpdater](https://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/api/net/sf/jasperreports/engine/util/ReportUpdater.html) implementations. Classes that inherit from the [ReportUpdater](https://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/api/net/sf/jasperreports/engine/util/ReportUpdater.html) interface should implement the following method:

```
public JasperDesign update(JasperDesign jasperDesign)
```

in order to perform specific modifications on the [JasperDesign](https://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/api/net/sf/jasperreports/engine/design/JasperDesign.html) object.


The JasperReports Maven Plugin has an `update` goal which allows performing such report template files update operation by accepting any number of report updaters to be added to its updaters list. Update operations will be applied sequential in the same order as the report updaters were added to the list. 

Here is an example of how to configure the `update` Maven plugin goal:

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>net.sf.jasperreports</groupId>
  <artifactId>jasperreports-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${jasperreports.version}</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>default-cli</id>
      <configuration>
        <outputDirectoryUpdate>${project.build.directory}/reports-update</outputDirectoryUpdate>
        <updaters>
          <updater>com.update.RenewUuidsUpdater</updater>
          <updater>com.update.StyleUpdater</updater>
        </updaters>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```
